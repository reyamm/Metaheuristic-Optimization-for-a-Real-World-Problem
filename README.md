# Metaheuristic Optimization for a Real-World Problem

This project applies Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to solve a real-world Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instance using the eil76 dataset from TSPLIB. The work follows the CS1463 project requirements and the methodology described in our proposal.

---

##  Project Overview

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) aims to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once. Because TSP is NP-hard, metaheuristic methods are commonly used to find strong approximate solutions efficiently. In this project, we implement and compare:

- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**  
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**  

Both algorithms are implemented from scratch.

## Methods Used

### Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Representation: permutation of city indices  
- Crossover: order-based crossover  
- Mutation: swap mutation  
- Selection: tournament / roulette-wheel (parameter dependent)  
- Fitness = total tour distance  

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- Ants construct tours based on pheromone + heuristic visibility  
- Pheromone evaporation and global updates  
- Probabilistic movement between cities  
- Tracks best solution across iterations

## Dataset

**eil76.tsp**  
- 76 cities  
- Euclidean distances  
- Standard TSPLIB benchmark used widely in optimization research  

---

## Results Summary

- GA best tour length ≈ **1736**  
- ACO best tour length ≈ **555** (scaled based on dataset definition)

The notebook includes:
- Convergence plots  
- Final generated tours visualized for both algorithms
